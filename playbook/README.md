# ios-playbook

Personal playbook for my iOS work.

Project setup

One of the first things I usually do is set the project version and build numbers. I like to manipulate the version's increments aautomaticattly, using build tools (fastlane). Fastlane relies on an Apple tool called agvtool. This usually requires some setup in build settings.

Another step I usually do as soon as possible is setup the app icon.

Another initial step is setting up Swiftlint, jazzy/swift-docs and Fastlane.


Code Styling and Conventions

In terms of code conventions, I tend to follow the standard adopted by the community. Most of the stardard rules are confirmed / checked by Swiftlint and/or Swift-Format.

Xcode

I use the Xcode defaults for code editing.
