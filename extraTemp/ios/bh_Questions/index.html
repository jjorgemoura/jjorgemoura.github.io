You have 30 seconds to convince me one way or the other.</li><li>Say that there is a function for which we can define a reasonable default, but we need to define specialised versions for a couple of edge cases. How can we do this in Swift?</li><li>Have you played with Swift Playgrounds? What are its key features and benefits?</li><li>Are you familiar with the latest changes in the Swift language itself? If so, can you elaborate on some of them?</li><li>When overriding an initialiser method in Obj-C, you generally call the super implementation before doing anything else. In Swift, the compiler will complain if you do that in certain situations. Do you know when and why?</li><li>What's your opinion about <code>Protocol Oriented Programming</code> as opposed to the more traditional approach we've had on iOS?</li><li>What are the differences between a <code>protocol</code> with a default implementation, and a <code>base class</code>?</li><li>Is it possible to define an instance method that applies to arrays of integers but <em>not</em> to arrays of doubles, or any other type? Can you think of an example when this could be useful? Do you happen to know the syntax?</li><li>What is the Swift embedded runtime?</li><li>What is the difference between <code>value semantics</code> and <code>reference semantics</code>?</li><li>So, say that you have a struct and one or more of its properties is of a reference type.
