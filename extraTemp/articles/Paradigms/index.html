Your app is one big pure function. That definition may work well for academics, because functional programs are a means of building formal mathematical proofs. But what about industrial programmers like us? In industrial projects, we do have side effects. We render the user interface, make payments, write to files, use the network, and send emails. These are all side effects. We want our users to be able to do all this stuff. Side effects are the reason why our apps are useful.</p></blockquote><p>Having side effects is necessary.</p><p>Thus, what we want (or could achive) is <strong><em>to have as many lines of code as possible in pure functions and as few as possible in side effects</em></strong>.</p><blockquote><p>The essence of functional programming is that it makes the distinction between pure code and impure code and minimizes the latter.</p></blockquote><p>The core of any functional programming relies on these 3 concepts:</p><blockquote><p>In a nutshell, a functional program can be broken into three parts: <strong>functions</strong>, <strong>effects</strong> and <strong>data</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>We can compare these concepts with Object-oriented programming languagues' own concepts, <strong>encapsulation</strong>, <strong>inheritance</strong> and <strong>polymorphism</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>You don’t want to use functional programming for websocket communication layer. Conversely, Fourier transform is naturally described with functions instead of objects and classes.</p></blockquote><h3>Functions</h3><p>In FP, by Function we mean, pure function.</p><p>A pure function can be defined as:</p><ul><li>cannot depend on anything that changes.</li></ul><ul><li>doesn’t change anything by itself.</li></ul><ul><li>can be called many times and it will return the same result every time.</li></ul><h3>Effects</h3><p>Unlike functions, calling an effect many times does not have the same result.</p><p>Effects depend on how many times they are called and when they are called.</p><p>For example, reading from a global or a mutable variable is another example of an effect, because it depends on when it happens. It is possible to have different values at different moments in time. Effects are hugely important because is where our code meets the real world.</p><p>However, effects are the most troublesome part of a program, because it makes a difference when, in what order, and how many times you run them.</p><h3>Data</h3><p>Data is information about an entity, represented in the memory. Data requires interpretation.</p><p>Data is represented as a type. Types are important because they define the kinds of computation allowed on certain data so that data knows how to interpret itself.</p><p>Reading from a mutable data structure is an effect. Therefore, in functional programming we strive to make use of immutable data structures.</p><h2>Is Swift Functional?</h2><p>No.</p><p>Swift has some features (map, reduce, first-class functions, pattern matching, etc) from functional languages. However, having those features doesn't mean we call it a full Functinal Language. Swift lacks, by default, much more functional features.</p><p>Some languages make it difficult to run an effect. For instance, Haskell has a special parameterized type called IO. Any value in an IO context must stay in this context. This doesn’t let you mix pure code with impure.</p><p>There is no rule that says we can do hybrid development, using OOP where best fits and Functional programming where makes sense.</p><h2>Stretch goal</h2><h3>Procedural vs Declarative</h3><p>This concept is related with the way we code, not the paradigm.</p><h2>References</h2><p><a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob - Clean Architecture</a></p><p><a href="https://robnapier.net/swift-is-not-functional">Rob Napier - Swift is not functional</a></p><p><a href="https://www.vadimbulavin.com/swift-functional-programming-fundamentals/">Practical Functional Programming in Swift: The Fundamentals</a></p></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>.
