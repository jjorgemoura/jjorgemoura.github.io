So much to learn and understand. It is not an easy topic.</p><p>Let's start with this <a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/capturing-objects-in-swift-closures">article</a> from Sundell, <strong>Capturing objects in Swift closures</strong>.</p><h2>Escaping / non-escaping</h2><p>There are two closures variants - escaping and non-escaping.</p><p>Escaping closures are simply closures that aren't run immediatly in the body of the method.</p><h4>no escaping</h4><pre><code class="language-swift">func applyMutliplication(value: Int, multFunction: Int -&gt; Int) -&gt; Int {
  return multFunction(value)
}
</code></pre><h4>escaping</h4><pre><code class="language-swift">//1
let actionHandlers: [String: () -&gt; Void]
func setAction(for element: String, action: @escapingString -&gt; String) {
 self.actionHandlers[element] = action
}

//2
var completionHandlers: [() -&gt; Void] = []
func someFunctionWithEscapingClosure(completionHandler: @escaping () -&gt; Void) {
    completionHandlers.append(completionHandler)
}
</code></pre><p>The escaping closures, because they capture context, can be source of some retain cycles. Thus, a technique to prevent this is so declare [weak self] when we set the closure.</p><p>For understand better arc, the best starting point is Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html">documentation</a>.</p><p>This <a href="https://oleb.net/blog/2016/10/optional-non-escaping-closures/">article</a> contain some useful tips about the escaping closures. Basically, it only apllies to function types.</p><h2>Autoclosures</h2><p>This is just a bit of syntax sugar.</p><p>&gt; An autoclosure is a closure that is automatically created to wrap an expression that’s being passed as an argument to a function. It doesn’t take any arguments, and when it’s called, it returns the value of the expression that’s wrapped inside of it. &gt;</p><p>This way we can omit braces around a function’s parameter.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">// customersInLine is ["Ewa", "Barry", "Daniella"]
func serve(customer customerProvider: @autoclosure () -&gt; String) {
    print("Now serving \(customerProvider())!")
}
serve(customer: customersInLine.remove(at: 0))
// Prints "Now serving Ewa!"
</code></pre><p><strong>Note (from Apple):</strong> &gt; Overusing autoclosures can make your code hard to understand. The context and function name should make it clear that evaluation is being deferred. &gt;</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It seems autoclosures are limited to closures that accept no parameters and returns someting.</p><h2>Retain Cycles</h2><p>To avoid retain cycles we must use <code>weak</code> or <code>unowned</code> variables.</p><p>If we have two classes that are referencing each other via properties, where both of which are allowed to be nil, there is the potential to cause a strong reference cycle. This scenario is best resolved with a weak reference. Suitable for when the weak instance will live less than the other instance.</p><p>Example to use <code>weak</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">class Person {
    let name: String
    init(name: String) { self.name = name }
    var apartment: Apartment?
    deinit { print("\(name) is being deinitialized") }
}
 
class Apartment {
    let unit: String
    init(unit: String) { self.unit = unit }
    weak var tenant: Person?
    deinit { print("Apartment \(unit) is being deinitialized") }
}
</code></pre><p>Note that both entities (Person and Apartment) can be <code>nil</code>.</p><p>If we have two classes that are referencing each other via properties, where one is allowed to be nil but not the other, there is the potential to cause a strong reference cycle. This scenario is best resolved with a unowned reference. Suitable for when the unowned instance will live the same or more than the other instance.</p><p>So, basically, <code>unowned</code> is the same as <code>weak</code> but because we think the variable will never be nill at the point we need to use it, then we can use <code>unowned</code> and, therefore, avoid the optional of the weak var.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">class Customer {
    let name: String
    var card: CreditCard?
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
    deinit { print("\(name) is being deinitialized") }
}
 
class CreditCard {
    let number: UInt64
    unowned let customer: Customer
    init(number: UInt64, customer: Customer) {
        self.number = number
        self.customer = customer
    }
    deinit { print("Card #\(number) is being deinitialized") }
}
</code></pre><p>The variable <code>Customer</code> is unowned because won't be nil.</p><p>Important note: &gt; Use an unowned reference only when you are sure that the reference always refers to an instance that has not been deallocated. &gt; If you try to access the value of an unowned reference after that instance has been deallocated, you’ll get a runtime error. &gt;</p><p>There is a third scenario. Is where both properties shouldn't be nil. This scenario is best resolved with a unowned reference for one property and a weak reference for the other property.</p><h2>Retain Cycles for Closures</h2><p>Now it's a bit more dificult to understand.</p><p>From Apple's, <em>Define a capture in a closure as an unowned reference when the closure and the instance it captures will always refer to each other, and will always be deallocated at the same time. Conversely, define a capture as a weak reference when the captured reference may become nil at some point in the future</em>.</p><p>in order to fix the Strong Reference Cycles in closures, we need to define a capture list as part of the closure’s definition.</p><p>From <a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/capturing-objects-in-swift-closures">here</a>, let's have a look on an example that causes a retain cycle in a closure.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">class ListViewController: UITableViewController {
    private let viewModel: ListViewModel

    init(viewModel: ListViewModel) {
        self.viewModel = viewModel

        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)

        viewModel.observeNumberOfItemsChanged {
            // This will cause a retain cycle, since our view controller
            // retains its view model, which in turn retains the view
            // controller by capturing it in an escaping closure.
            self.tableView.reloadData()
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>We can think of <code>viewModel.</code> to know and to keep a reference to the <code>viewController</code> instance, with both not being optionals.</p><p>One way to fix this retain cycle is to capture self as weak (<code>viewModel.observeNumberOfItemsChanged { [weak self] in</code>)</p><p>Every time we set a weak variable, that variable will be optional. So, when using that varable we can use it as:</p><ul><li>an optional (?)</li></ul><ul><li>optional binding (<code>if let</code> or <code>guard let</code>)</li></ul><p><strong>Some resources:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/capturing-objects-in-swift-closures">https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/capturing-objects-in-swift-closures</a></p><p><a href="https://krakendev.io/blog/weak-and-unowned-references-in-swift">https://krakendev.io/blog/weak-and-unowned-references-in-swift</a></p><p><a href="https://www.uraimo.com/2016/10/27/unowned-or-weak-lifetime-and-performance/">https://www.uraimo.com/2016/10/27/unowned-or-weak-lifetime-and-performance/</a></p><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24320347/shall-we-always-use-unowned-self-inside-closure-in-swift/34542424">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24320347/shall-we-always-use-unowned-self-inside-closure-in-swift/34542424</a></p><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24011575/what-is-the-difference-between-a-weak-reference-and-an-unowned-reference/26025176#26025176">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24011575/what-is-the-difference-between-a-weak-reference-and-an-unowned-reference/26025176#26025176</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.haloneuro.com/swift-memory-leak-gotcha-with-weak-self-67293d5bc060">https://blog.haloneuro.com/swift-memory-leak-gotcha-with-weak-self-67293d5bc060</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@streem/understanding-memory-leaks-in-closures-48207214cba">https://medium.com/@streem/understanding-memory-leaks-in-closures-48207214cba</a></p><p><a href="https://oleb.net/blog/2016/10/optional-non-escaping-closures/">https://oleb.net/blog/2016/10/optional-non-escaping-closures/</a></p></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>.
