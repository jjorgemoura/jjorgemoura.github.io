There is no right or wrong answer. There is always some tradeoffs. We need to understand a complex bunch of different things. There is, though, always a set of horrible answers.</p><h3>Tip:</h3><p>Interview structure: Fuzzy problem with a few (super important) details. Also, there will be a very specific constraints to satisfy.</p><h3>Tip:</h3><p>These kind of interviews are useful to look at <strong><em>Technical Leadership</em></strong> skills.</p><h3>Notes:</h3><p>I can explore my process in the past, when all the system architecture and design started with a ER model in the database.</p><h3>Specific Example:</h3><p>Build, for a very successful multi-platform app, with 500M users per month, a logging system in the app to send debug information to our backend.</p><p>Initially we should explore all the information that is given to us. Question that information.</p><p>For example, what mean 500M users a month? for example, this number doesn't tell us anything. At least, something important or relevant for our problem. I would say the important aspect for our system is average users at same time (peak traffic). This will tell us the load that our backend should handle. Probably will be around 68k concurrently at peak time. Can the server handle this load of users?!</p><p>Some topics expected to be covered:</p><ul><li>battery consumption</li><li>cellular data consumption</li><li>on device implications<ul><li>how to storage while offline</li><li>will interrupt UI Thread</li><li>how to send all the information (API strategy)</li><li>time frequency or by event</li><li>server implications in terms of resources and workload.</li><li>how much more work load is this compared with the present situation. Is this just a new endpoint among 40 others (so a minor increase) or is this like an increase of 25% of endpoints?</li><li>how much data (size) can we transmit to the server with:</li><li>the user notice and realise it is to much,</li><li>the server provider (network provider) complaint regarding the excessive traffic</li><li>the server provider realise how much storage it will be needed</li><li>how data is transmitted:</li><li>encrypted?</li><li>compressed?</li><li>protocol?</li><li>stored locally (and for how long)</li><li>if offline, how to synchronise data (and be sure nothing is lost)</li><li>how to support different platforms</li><li>ios</li><li>android</li><li>windows phone</li><li>apple TV</li><li>chromecast</li><li>smart TVs</li><li>etc</li><li>Technology stack</li><li>on client</li><li>on server</li><li>can we send, or should, info via mobile data or WiFi only</li><li>we can also explore how long (resources) will take this to be built</li><li>all team</li><li>resources</li><li>maintenance cost</li><li>how to access this logs (by whom, from where)</li><li>data privacy (in different countries)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Basically, the idea behind is talk about high scale systems.</p><h3>Tip:</h3><p><strong><em>Break down the problem.</em></strong> Focus initially on the things or areas we are more comfortable with. After, address the other areas. Is the way we face the other areas that show our capabilities when face something new and challenging.</p><p><strong><em>Make steady progress</em></strong> through the fuzzy problem, with approximations that are like reasonable.</p><p><strong><em>Keep going</em></strong> explore all the details, don't give up. (Winston Churchill once say, "If you are going through hell, keep going!")</p><p><strong><em>Ted Talk</em></strong> face this as a talk where you present to the other person what vision about this problem. Could be a kind of elevator pitch.</p><p>Probably a good training tip, or demonstration in a real interview, is using mental maps to write down all the bits.</p><h3>Tip:</h3><p>Try to engage with the interviewer. The idea, as I already know, is to see if the person is compatible with the team, if the team would like to work every day with this new potential member. A bad attitude is a very bad signal.</p><h3>NOTE:</h3><blockquote><p><strong><em>ARE YOU BUSY LIVING OR BUSY DYING</em></strong>from <strong><em>If you're not busy being born, you're busy dying? (by Bob Dylan)</em></strong></p></blockquote><h3>Tip:</h3><p>I need to demonstrate <strong><em>I have been pushing myself</em></strong>. That <strong><em>I'm not complacent</em></strong>.</p><p>Being in this kind of process already demonstrate a bit of not be complacent. In my past I think I have demonstrated that a couple of times, even if in others I was complacent. Damm!!!</p><h3>Final Points</h3><ul><li>The goal of these interviews are, no matter the level we are, or how far we are in the carreer, designed to find the interviewee's edges and boundaries. So a to easy interview is a bad sign. Probably a very hard interview is also a bad sign. It should be like a eye test, you want to end with the correct level.</li><li>When we achieve a big architectural win, we need to talk about then. <strong><em>We must to talk about them</em></strong>. We should talk about them:<ul><li>internally</li><li>in blogs</li><li>in conferences</li><li>Read and follow every technical information (blogs, presentations, etc) and people from the company you want to join in order to be exposed to their ecosystem, challenges, achievements, limitations, etc.</li><li>The tech industry will hire any person with passion on that domain to be awesome. So, we need to be passion on something in orders of magnitude that will make us a "reference" in that subject.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Some Ideas:</h2><ul><li>Photo sync (iCloud)</li><li>Calendar Sync</li><li>Address Book Sync</li><li>Messenger Service</li><li>News Feed / Live feed (twitter, BBC Live)</li><li>Image processing (combining photos from multiple lenses and combine in one consolidated photo)</li></ul><h2>Some Links:</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entityâ€“relationship_model">Entity-Relationship Model</a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model">Relational Model</a></p></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
