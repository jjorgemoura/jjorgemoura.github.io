Kind of ReplaySubject but with buffer size of 1.</p><p>• <strong>ReplaySubject</strong>: Initialized with a <code>buffer size</code> and will maintain a buffer of elements up to that size and replay it to new subscribers.</p><p>• <strong>AsyncSubject</strong>: An AsyncSubject emits the last value (and only the last value) emitted by the source Observable only after that source completes. If the source Observable does not emit any values, or emits an error, the AsyncSubject also completes without emitting any values.</p><p>• <strong>Variable</strong>: Wraps a <strong>BehaviorSubject</strong>, preserves its current value as state, and replays only the latest/initial value to new subscribers. There is no way to add an .error or .completed event onto a variable. Any attempts to do so will generate compiler errors. So basically, Variable is a BehaviorSubject without error or completed. I think variable is now deprecated.</p><h2>Traits</h2><p>Documentation <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/master/Documentation/Traits.md">here</a></p><h3>Driver</h3><p>Driver intention is to provide an intuitive way to write reactive code in the UI layer, or for any case where you want to model a stream of data Driving your application.</p><ul><li>Can't error out</li><li>Observe occurs on main scheduler</li><li>Shares side effects (shareReplayLatestWhileConnected)</li></ul><p>It is named Driver because its intended use case was to model sequences that drive your application.</p><p>E.g.</p><ul><li>Drive UI from CoreData model</li><li>Drive UI using values from other UI elements (bindings)</li></ul><p>Like normal operating system drivers, in case a sequence errors out, your application will stop responding to user input.

You could compare it to using an Observable<Void> that can't emit elements.

### Maybe 

A Maybe is a variation of Observable that is right in between a Single and a Completable. It can either emit a single element, complete without emitting an element, or emit an error.

**Note**: Any of these three events would terminate the Maybe, meaning - a Maybe that completed can't also emit an element, and a Maybe that emitted an element can't also send a Completion event.

- Emits either a completed event, a single element or an error
- Doesn't share side effects

You could use Maybe to model any operation that could emit an element, but doesn't necessarily have to emit an element.


## RxCocoa

### Bind

Bind is a kind of `subscribe`. Stablish the observer link.



## Notes

### Side effects

What is `side effects`?

If you want to register callbacks that will be executed when certain events take place on an Observable Sequence you need to use the doOn Operator. It will not modify the emitted elements but rather just pass them through. 

- do(onNext:) - if you want to do something just if a next event happened
- do(onError:) - if errors will be emitted and
- do(onCompleted:) - if the sequence finished successfully.

```
Observable.of(1,2,3,4,5).do(onNext: {
    $0 * 10 // This has no effect on the actual subscription
}).subscribe(onNext:{
    print($0)
})

$ 1
$ 2
$ 3
$ 4
$ 5
```

More detailed:

Each subscription generates a new observable stream. Imagine the ones generated through `Obsevable.create`. We can ending up creating a different stream each time. So, in order to asssure the stream is the same, we can can `share()`. 

A similar concept and operator is the `shareReplay(i)`, used for when we want to the last i elements of a sequence, even after the sequence has terminated. 

>
The rule of thumb for using shareReplay(_) is to use it on any sequences you expect to complete. This way you prevent the observable from being re-created.

More and usefull info [here](https://medium.com/@_achou/rxswift-share-vs-replay-vs-sharereplay-bea99ac42168).

Basically the difference between `share` and `shareReplay(i)` is that when you subscribe with `shareReplay` you receive the previous(es) event(s) from buffer. Using `shareReplayLatestWhileConnected` basically is `shareReplay(i)` where `i = 1`.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>.
